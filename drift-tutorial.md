# Drift Tutoral
This tutorial takes you through the initial steps in setting up a Drift development environment and run the basic Drift services on your local workstation.

## Create a new everything from scratch.
Scenario: A game company called **KneeDeep Studios** with a title called **Snowfall**.

### Install Pre-requisites

The tutorial assumes you are using [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). Please install and use it before continuing. [OSX setup](http://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/iTerm/zsh.html) is available as well.

> Note: Drift is Python based. [Virtual envs](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) are nice. It's a good idea to `pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper` and do `mkvirtualenv drift` and work within that virtual environment.

For local development, the following packages are needed:
#### OSX
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/dgnorth/drift-config.git
pip install git+https://github.com/dgnorth/drift-base.git@develop
brew install postgresql
brew install redis
```

Run the Redis server simply by executing `redis-server`.

To set up the PostgreSQL server, see [PostgreSQL setup](postgres-setup.md).


### Create Drift Configuration Database
A single configuration database covers all configuration settings for Drift based tiers and apps. Managing this database is done using the `dconf` command line suite (and `driftconfig` in some cases).

Let's create a configuration database for **KneeDeep Studios**:
```bash
# We pick a location in our home directory
driftconfig create kdstudios file://~/kdstudios
driftconfig push kdstudios

# List out configuration DB's
driftconfig list
```

You can have multiple Drift configuration DB's active on your local workstation. To list them out,


list out all DB's using the command `driftconfig list`. If there is **more than one** on your local machine, you need to explicitly point to it using a command line option, or add a reference to it through environment variable: `DRIFT_CONFIG_URL=kdstudios`.

### Set up a tier
A tier is a single slice of development or operation environment. It's a good practice to start with the live tier and if necessary add a dev and staging tier later, even though the live tier will only be used for development in the beginning.

For this tutorial however, we need a local development tier as well, so we will create one live and one local development tier:


### Register plugins and set up tiers

```bash
# Add a live tier and a local development tier
dconf tier add LIVE --is-live
dconf tier add LOCAL --is-dev

# Register all available Drift plugins in the config DB and associate
# with all available tiers
dconf deployable register all -t all
```

### Register our organization and product
Now we have our LIVE tier set up, but all services need to run in the context of a product. Next step is to set up our organization and product.

```bash
# Arguments: organization name, short name, display name
dconf organization add kdstudios kd -d "Knee Deep Studios"

# Arguments: product name prefixed with the organization short name
dconf product add kd-snowfall
```


### Create a tenant
Drift is a multi-tenant platform. For our scenario we just need to create a tenant for our local development. Additional tenants can be created at any time as well.

Tenant names must be prefixed with the organization short name. Having the word 'default' in the name will make it the default tenant when running a service locally.

```bash
# Arguments: tenant name, product name
dconf tenant add kd-defaultdev kd-snowfall
```
At this point we have all the necessarty bits registered in our configuration database. Next steps are all about provisioning and running the actual services.

### Running a service locally
Run the following command to start the Drift web server on your machine:

```bash
drift-admin runserver -s drift-base
```

The server should be up and running on port 10080. To try it out:
```bash
curl -H accept:application/json http://localhost:10080
```

> Note: The 'drift-base' argument can be ommitted if cwd is in the repository of the project. Example: `➜  drift-base git:(develop) ✗ drift-admin runserver`

Using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) for development is highly encouraged. There are other ways as well, but managing authorized sessions is best done using Postman and a set of helper scripts.

### What next
Next up is to set up the LIVE tier on AWS. Please follow the steps described in [Drift on AWS](drift-on-aws.md)

The final exercise is to create a new deployable/service. Please follow the steps described in [Drift Deployables](drift-deployables.md)


## Appendix (and scratch pad)

### AWS support
If you want AWS development and operation environment, make sure you have the AWS CLI suite installed, and access and secret keys set up on your local computer.

```bash
pip install awscli
aws configure

```
